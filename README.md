Wordpress plugin development - 101
==================================
	Lets say one just needs to write some functions and thats it.

Well, probably that's over simplification. But thats all one need to do.
 - Wordpress has global functions all over it.
 - Wordpress runs kind of in a procedural way.
 - Wordpress has some event hooks 
 - As a plugin developer, one just have to write a function for a particular hook
